          Jasimuddin (1 January 1903- 13 March 1976), popularly called Palli
          Kabi (lit.'Pastoral Poet'), was a Bengali poet, lyricist, composer and
          writer widely celebrated for his modern ballad sagas in the pastoral
          mode.[1] Although his full name is Jasim Uddin Mollah, he is known as
          Jasim Uddin.[2] His Nakshi Kanthar Math and Sojan Badiar Ghat are
          considered among the best lyrical poems in the Bengali language.[3] He
          is the key figure for the revivals of pastoral literature in Bengal
          during the 20th century.[1] As a versatile writer, Jasimuddin wrote
          poems, ballads, songs, dramas, novel, stories, memoirs, travelogues,
          etc.[4] Born in Faridpur, Jasimuddin was educated at Culcutta

          joined the University of Dhaka and taught there for 5 years.[5] In
          1944, he joined the Department of Information and Broadcasting of the
          then government and retired in 1962.[5] "An ardent supporter of
          socialism" and Bengali language movement, Jasimuddin was "one of the
          pioneers of the progressive and non-communal cultural movement" during
          1950s and 1960s.[5] He was awarded the President's Award for Pride of
          Performance in 1958, Ekushey Padak in 1976 and Swadhinata Dibas
          Puruskar posthumously in 1978.[5] He rejected Bangla Academy Award in
          1974.[5] In January 2018, Bangla Academy announced Jasimuddin Literary
          Award, a biennial award to be given for life-time contribution to
          Bangla literature.[6]รก
