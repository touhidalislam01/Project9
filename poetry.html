        <div class="About-2">
          Jasimuddin started writing poems at a young age. As a college student,
          he wrote the celebrated poem Kabar (The Grave), a simple tone to
          obtain family religion and tragedy. The poem was placed in the
          entrance Bengali textbook while he was still a student of Calcutta
          University. Jasimuddin is noted for his depiction of rural life and
          nature from the viewpoint of rural people. This had earned the title
          as Palli Kabi (the rural poet). The structure and content of his
          poetry bear a strong flavor of Bengal folklore. His Nakshi Kanthar
          Math (Field of the Embroidered Quilt) and Sojan Badiar Ghat (Gypsy
          Wharf) is considered two masterpieces and has been translated into
          many different languages.[citation needed] Jasimuddin was introduced
          with Abbas Uddin by poet Golam Mostofa in a musical program held in
          Kolkata in 1931.[8]
